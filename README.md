# Bike-Sales-Excel-Dashboard

This is a Sales Analysis Project that focuses on analyzing bike sales data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset consists of various factors related to customers and their purchasing behavior.

### To achieve the goal of this project, I have completed several tasks.
✅ Understanding the provided dataset.<br/>
✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing within Excel to ensure data quality and consistency.<br/>
    This involved: - Removing any duplicates, spaces, and special characters, find and replace, and formatting. <br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Creating custom columns (Age Brackets) to extract additional information from the dataset.<br/>
✅ Pivot Tables and Charts: Utilizing Excel's pivot tables and charting features, I created visualizations to uncover trends and insights related to different aspects of the dataset.<br/>
✅ Sales Analysis Dashboard: The project culminates in a visual dashboard created in entirely in Excel with slicers. This interactive dashboard provides an overview of the sales data and allows users to explore key metrics and trends.<br/>

### Usage
To explore the project:
1. Download the Bike Sales Dashboard.xlsx file from this repository.
2. Open the Excel file using Microsoft Excel or an equivalent spreadsheet software.
3. Navigate through the different sheets to view the data, pivot tables, charts, and the interactive dashboard.
Feel free to customize the project according to your needs and use it as a reference for your own Excel-based analysis.
